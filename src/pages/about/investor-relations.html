            The Birth of Bonema
          </h2>
          <p>
            BONEMA stands for BO-KANG NE-O MA-EMILI (BO-NE-MA), a family of 3
            entrepreneurs and business professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2014 Bokang developed the first Bonema Track, a real time
            tracking device that passed insurance certification with a perfect
            score, under both tracking and recovery. Bonema Track by then
            already had 10s data upload capability, pinpoint accuracy upto 5m
            and communicated on multiple gateways to counter signal jamming and
            inaccurate data reporting of false positives. This was just the
            start of more innovation with more in-housed product solutions for
            fleets, assets, POS solutions and voltage stabilizers.<br />
            We continue to persevere despite the environment being positioned to
            deter new entrants in the highly regulated and monopolized
            telematics and IT asset management industries. Our innovations speak
            for themselves; Bonema Tracking, Bonema Fleet Solutions, Bonema Fuel
            Management, Bonema FleetCam Solutions and our latest Bonema Asset
            Manager with The Bonema Magic Wand.<br />
            The Bonema Magic Wand is a wireless Scanner tool that reads and
            reconciles assets in a location in seconds. The latest Bonema
            innovation cuts down the asset verification process to a tenth. Our
            barcode scanning tool allows you scan all assets simultaneously at
            the entrance of each location, without bending over or lifting a
            finder.<br />
            Imagine an Asset Management software system that pulls the below
            reports and reconciles them against the previous audit/maintenance,
            while reporting on deviations/descrapencies by JUST waving The
            Bonema Magic Wand across the room IN A MATTER OF SECONDS.. Well look
            no further Bonema Asset Manager is here.
