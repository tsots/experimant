            Server Clusters
          </h2>
          <p>
            Working with the market leaders in the delivery of enterprise
            servers HP and Oracle/SUN, Bonema Technologies provides a complete
            range of servers and platforms. Ranging from standalone servers to
            complex blade arrays and business critical systems, HP and SUN blend

            Virtualisation
          </h2>
          <p>
            Every enterprise today needs to consider virtualised systems
            environments. This not only saves on capital investments, but also
            on energy, operations and support. Virtualisation offers a higher
            level of resiliency and backup, and makes complex server
            environments easy to manage. Working with RedHat, VMware and
            Microsoft, Bonema Technologies offer design, implementation and
            support of virtualised server and desktop environments.

            Storage Management
          </h2>
          <p>
            With the data requirements of enterprises growing dramatically over
            the last years, managing storage deployment and support has become
            an increasingly complex and costly requirement. HP, SUN and Hitachi
            are three of the leaders we work with in the deployment of storage
            solutions which can cater for small business but can also scale to
            data centre requirements. Bonema Technologies will provide
            assistance in the design and deployment of such set-ups, making sure
            that the appropriate security and resilience is built into the
            systems
