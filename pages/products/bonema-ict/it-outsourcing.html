            Having IT up and running on a 24 hour basis has become critical for
            most organisations. To be able to do that effectively, and with a
            clear return on investment is not easy. IT has become complex, and
            requires expertise in various areas; applications, servers,
            virtualisation, disaster recovery, storage, networking and security.
            Trying to do all this internally is no longer an option for smaller
            companies.<br>
            At Bonema Technologies we have an operational team who are focused
            on providing these services to different sized organisations. The
            team can some in at various levels, from offering specific
            consulting and 2nd level support to existing teams, to taking over
            the complete IT operations. The ICT team can also come in to help
            companies develop a strategic view to IT deployment, making sure
            that they are aligning their investments to business requirements.
